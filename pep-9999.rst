Abstract
========

This PEP formalizes a model for docs governance. Although the Steering 
Council has already approved the creation of an editorial board for 
Python's docs, this PEP documents and formalizes how the editorial board 
will work. 

Specification
=============

The Editorial Board
--------------------

Composition
~~~~~~~~~~~

[DISCUSSION: Do we want to set limits on the number of members?]


Mandate
~~~~~~~

The editorial board will:

* Maintain and improve the quality of Python's documentation
* Make contributing to documentation as accessible, inclusive, 
  and sustainable as possible
* Establish appropriate decision-making processes for documentaion
* Seek consensus among contributors before acting in a formal capacity
* Be the final arbiter for docs decisions


Powers
~~~~~~

The board has authority to make decisions about documentation.
For example, they can:

* Set big-picture strategy for documentation
* Restructure documentation
* Make style decisions
* Handle docs governance (e.g. Do docs pages have owners? How do we 
  resolve disagreements? How do we decide what to include?)


Joining the Editorial Board
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[DISCUSSION: How should new board members be added?]

Editorial board members have:

- A good grasp of the philosophy of the Python project
- A background in Python education and developer-facing documentation
- A solid track record of being constructive and helpful
